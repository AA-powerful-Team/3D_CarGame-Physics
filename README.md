# Physics library implementations mini games

Projects created for Physics II subject. 
- First game Re-created is a 2D Pinball Game done with BoxD library. 
- Second game created is a racing track Mini-Game with obstacles, time trial & jumps. Done with Bullet 3D library

Both games created only with C and C++ and the implmented libraries.

These projects have been done by two students of CITM - UPC (Barcelona, Spain).
